## Known Issues

1. **Database Schema**: Further refinement needed for different tournament formats
2. **Development Environment**: Local setup instructions need completion
3. **File Storage**: Strategy for user uploads not fully defined
4. **Authentication Flow**: Refresh token mechanism to be determined
5. **Offline Strategy**: Implementation details need refinement

## Current Sprint Focus

The current development sprint is focused on:

1. Completing the authentication system (both backend and frontend)
2. Implementing basic tournament management functionality
3. Developing the team registration process
4. Setting up initial UI components and pages

# Project Progress Log

## Current Progress: 65%

### Completed (65%)

1. **Project Setup & Configuration (100%)**
   - Initial project structure created with frontend and backend directories
   - Basic README created with project overview

   - Connection using IPv4-compatible connection pooler configured
   - SSL configuration set up for secure connections
   - Sequelize ORM integration completed
   - Database testing utilities created
   - Currently troubleshooting connection issues with Supabase

4. **API Routes (80%)**
   - Authentication routes (register, login) implemented
   - User management routes implemented (update profile, change password)
   - Tournament routes (CRUD operations) implemented
   - Routes organized with proper middleware

5. **Frontend Structure (40%)**

### In Progress (Planned for next sprint)

1. **Frontend Development (10%)**
   - Component architecture defined
   - Need to implement authentication pages
   - Need to implement tournament management interfaces
   - Need to implement user profile management

2. **Database Migration & Seeding (10%)**
   - Initial seeders created
   - Need to finalize migration scripts
   - Need to complete test data seeding

3. **Integration & Testing (5%)**
   - Basic API tests created
   - Need to implement comprehensive test suite
   - Need to perform end-to-end testing

### Upcoming (Not Started)

1. **Deployment & DevOps (0%)**
   - CI/CD pipeline setup
   - Production environment configuration
   - Performance optimization
   - Security hardening

2. **Documentation (20%)**
   - Memory bank initiated
   - Project overview created
   - Need to complete API documentation
   - Need to create user guides

## Current Focus

- **Database Connectivity**: Resolving connection issues with Supabase PostgreSQL
- **Supabase Integration**: Testing database connectivity with IPv4-compatible connection pooler
- **Error Handling**: Implementing comprehensive error handling for database connections and API responses

## Recent Challenges & Solutions

- **IPv6 Connectivity**: Discovered that Supabase direct connection requires IPv6 support, which was causing connection issues. Solution was to switch to Supabase's connection pooler which supports IPv4.
- **Connection String Format**: Refined the connection string format to use the correct username format for Supabase pooler connections (`postgres.{project_ref}`).
- **DNS Resolution**: Identified and addressed DNS resolution issues for Supabase hostnames.

## Next Steps

1. Verify successful connection to Supabase database
2. Complete backend API integration with database
3. Implement database seeds for development testing
4. Start frontend development with authentication screens
5. Implement containerization for easier development environment setup
