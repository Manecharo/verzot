# Verzot: Active Context

## Current State

The Verzot project is a tournament management platform for amateur sports, focusing initially on soccer/football. The application has reached its MVP milestone with all core functionality implemented.

The project structure is established with:
- Frontend: React application using Context API for state management
- Backend: Express.js API with Sequelize ORM
- Database: PostgreSQL via Supabase
- Authentication: Supabase Auth
- File Storage: Supabase Storage

All major frontend components have been developed and the backend API routes are implemented with some minor features still pending. The MVP includes core functionality for:

1. **User Authentication and Profile Management**
   - Registration and login
   - Profile management with image upload
   - Role-based permissions (basic implementation)

2. **Tournament Management**
   - Creation and configuration
   - Team registration
   - Match scheduling
   - Results management
   - Standings visualization
   - Tournament brackets for knockout stages

3. **Match Management**
   - Match creation and scheduling
   - Match results and status tracking
   - Enhanced match events recording (goals, cards, etc.)
   - Field position tracking for events

4. **Player Management**
   - Player profiles
   - Player statistics derived from match events
   - Team management

5. **Notification System**
   - Real-time updates via Socket.io
   - Notification preferences
   - In-app and email notifications (email configured but disabled in dev)
   - Notification badge and notification center

The frontend is deployed on Vercel, but the backend deployment is still pending. Several features like offline capability, payment processing, and admin controls are planned for future development.
