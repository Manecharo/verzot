# Verzot: Active Context

## Current Project State

The Verzot project is in the initial setup and implementation phase. The basic project structure has been established with both frontend (React) and backend (Express) components. The database models have been defined using Sequelize ORM, establishing the foundation for the data architecture.

## Current Work Focus

The current focus is on building out the core functionality of the application:

1. **Database Schema**: All core models have been defined with their relationships:
   - User model for authentication
   - Role and UserRole models for permissions
   - Tournament model for tournament management
   - Team and Player models for team management
   - Match and MatchEvent models for game tracking
   - TeamTournament junction for team-tournament relationships
   - Subscription model for premium features

2. **Server Setup**: Basic Express server with Socket.io integration has been configured.

3. **Project Structure**: Both frontend and backend structures have been established with the necessary dependency configurations.

## Recent Changes

The following key components have been implemented:

1. **Backend Database Models**: 
   - Created all necessary Sequelize models
   - Defined relationships between models
   - Set up appropriate validation rules

2. **Backend Server Configuration**:

   - Implement team registration workflows
   - Create match scheduling functionality

### Frontend Development
1. **Authentication UI**:
   - Create login and registration forms
   - Implement JWT token storage and management
   - Develop protected route system

2. **Tournament Management UI**:
   - Design and implement tournament creation/editing interfaces
   - Create tournament browsing and filtering components
   - Develop team registration workflows

3. **Real-time Features**:
   - Implement Socket.io client integration
   - Create live score updating components
   - Develop real-time notification system

### Integration Tasks
1. **API Service Layer**:
   - Create frontend service modules for API communication
   - Implement error handling and loading states
   - Develop authentication header management

2. **State Management**:
   - Set up React Context API for global state
   - Create reducers and actions for state mutations
   - Implement hooks for accessing shared state

## Active Decisions and Considerations

1. **Authentication Strategy**:
   - Using JWT tokens for stateless authentication
   - Considering refresh token strategy for better security
   - Need to determine token expiration policies

2. **Database Schema Refinements**:
   - Considering additional fields for the Match model to support different tournament formats
   - Evaluating indexing strategies for optimal query performance
   - Considering audit trails for critical data changes

3. **Frontend Architecture**:
   - Evaluating whether to use CSS Modules or Styled Components
   - Considering implementing a component library vs. custom components
   - Planning responsive design strategy for mobile-first approach

4. **API Design**:
   - Defining standardized response formats
   - Planning pagination strategy for list endpoints
   - Considering filtering and sorting capabilities

5. **Testing Strategy**:
   - Defining unit testing approach for backend services
   - Planning integration testing for API endpoints
   - Considering frontend component testing strategy

## Blocking Issues

1. **Database Connectivity**: Need to establish a development database for testing
2. **Environment Setup**: Need to create proper .env files for local development
3. **Frontend Asset Preparation**: Need design assets (logos, icons, color schemes)

## Open Questions

1. Should we implement server-side rendering for improved SEO and performance?
2. How should we handle image uploads and storage in the MVP phase?
3. What level of offline functionality should we prioritize for the MVP?
4. How should we structure the tournament brackets for different formats?
5. What metrics should we track for analytics in the initial release?

## Current Focus

We are currently focusing on establishing a stable connection to our Supabase PostgreSQL database using the connection pooler (Session mode). This is crucial before we can proceed with implementing the API functionality and seeding the database with initial data.

## Current Challenges

1. **Database Connectivity**: 
   - We encountered connectivity issues with the direct connection to Supabase PostgreSQL as it requires IPv6 support
   - We're now using the Supabase connection pooler which supports IPv4
   - Still troubleshooting "Tenant or user not found" errors which suggest username formatting issues

2. **Environment Configuration**:
   - Ensuring proper environment variables are set for database connection
   - SSL configuration for secure database connections
   - Error handling to provide meaningful feedback during connection attempts

## Immediate Priorities

1. **Database Connection**:
   - Verify the correct format for the connection pooler URL
   - Confirm that Supabase project ID and credentials are correct
   - Successfully connect to the database and perform a simple query

2. **Initial Database Setup**:
   - Once connected, run database migrations to create tables
   - Seed the database with initial data for testing
   - Verify model relationships are correctly established

3. **API Testing**:
   - Test the authentication routes
   - Test user management routes
   - Test tournament management routes

## Architecture Decisions

1. **Supabase PostgreSQL**: 
   - Using Supabase for managed PostgreSQL database to simplify infrastructure
   - Connection pooler for better compatibility with IPv4-only environments
   - SSL enabled for secure connections

2. **Sequelize ORM**:
   - Using Sequelize for database access abstraction
   - Models defined with associations for relationships
   - Database syncing with `alter: true` in development mode

3. **Express.js API**:
   - RESTful API design with versioning (/api/v1)
   - Middleware for authentication and validation
   - Structured controllers for organized business logic

## Recent Progress

1. **Database Configuration**:
   - Created database connection configuration with Sequelize
   - Implemented comprehensive error handling for connection issues
   - Created utility script for testing database connection

2. **API Implementation**:
   - Implemented authentication routes and controllers
   - Implemented user management routes and controllers
   - Implemented tournament management routes and controllers

3. **Documentation**:
   - Updated memory bank with technical context
   - Created detailed database connection guide
   - Updated progress tracking

## Next Steps

1. **Resolve Database Connection Issues**:
   - Verify the correct username format for Supabase connection pooler
   - Test with alternate connection string formats if needed
   - Confirm with Supabase documentation for latest connection requirements

2. **Database Initialization**:
   - Once connected, run initial migrations
   - Seed with test data
   - Verify relationships work as expected

3. **API Testing**:
   - Implement comprehensive testing of all routes
   - Validate authentication flow works end-to-end
   - Ensure proper error handling throughout the API
